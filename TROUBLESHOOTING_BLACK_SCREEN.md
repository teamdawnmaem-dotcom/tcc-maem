# Troubleshooting Black Screen Issue

## Quick Diagnosis Steps

### Step 1: Test RTSP Connection
Run the test script to check if your camera connection is working:

```bash
cd C:\Github\tcc-maem\recognition
python test_connection.py
```

This will tell you:
- ‚úÖ If Laravel API is accessible
- ‚úÖ If cameras are configured
- ‚úÖ If RTSP streams are accessible
- ‚úÖ If frames can be read from the camera

### Step 2: Start Service with Logs
Start the service and watch for the startup messages:

```bash
cd C:\Github\tcc-maem\recognition
python service.py
```

**Look for these messages:**
```
üöÄ Starting TCC-MAEM Recognition Service...
üì° Fetching cameras...
‚úÖ Loaded X cameras
üìÖ Fetching today's schedule...
‚úÖ Loaded schedules for X rooms
üë§ Fetching faculty embeddings...
‚úÖ Loaded embeddings for X faculty members
üé¨ Starting background recognition threads...
‚úÖ Started X background threads
üåê Starting web server on port 5000...
```

**Then watch for these messages:**
```
üé¨ Starting background thread for camera 1 - Feed: rtsp://...
Creating shared capture for camera 1
‚úÖ Shared capture created for camera 1
‚úÖ Background processing started for camera 1 (Room XXX)
üìπ Camera 1: 100 frames captured
üìπ Camera 1: 200 frames captured
```

### Step 3: Check Browser Console
Open your browser's Developer Tools (F12) and check for errors:

**Good signs:**
```
WebRTC connection established for camera: XXX
Video can play for camera: XXX
```

**Bad signs:**
```
Failed to fetch
Cannot connect to recognition service
WebRTC connection failed
```

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Issue 1: "No cameras found"
**Symptoms:** Service says "Loaded 0 cameras"

**Solution:**
1. Make sure Laravel is running: `php artisan serve`
2. Add cameras in the Laravel admin panel
3. Verify API endpoint: `http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/cameras`

### Issue 2: "Failed to open shared capture"
**Symptoms:** Service shows `‚ùå Failed to create shared capture for camera X`

**Causes:**
- RTSP URL is wrong
- Camera is offline
- Network connectivity issue
- Camera doesn't support the codec

**Solution:**
1. Test with VLC: Open VLC ‚Üí Media ‚Üí Open Network Stream ‚Üí Paste RTSP URL
2. Check camera settings for RTSP configuration
3. Verify network connectivity to camera
4. Try different RTSP transport (TCP vs UDP)

### Issue 3: "Camera read failed"
**Symptoms:** Service shows `‚ö†Ô∏è Camera X read failed, retrying in 10s`

**Causes:**
- Unstable network connection
- Camera stream interrupted
- Camera restarted

**Solution:**
- Check network stability
- Restart the camera
- Check camera logs for errors

### Issue 4: "WebRTC connection failed"
**Symptoms:** Browser console shows connection failures

**Causes:**
- Recognition service not running
- Port 5000 is blocked
- CORS issues

**Solution:**
1. Verify service is running: `http://127.0.0.1:5000/health`
2. Check Windows Firewall allows port 5000
3. Check browser console for CORS errors

### Issue 5: Black screen but recording works
**Symptoms:** 
- Recordings save successfully to `storage/app/public/stream_recordings/`
- Live feed shows black screen
- No "recognition service not running" error

**This means:**
- ‚úÖ RTSP connection works
- ‚úÖ Recording works
- ‚ùå Shared frame buffer not working
- ‚ùå Background thread not starting

**Solution:**
This is what we're fixing! The changes made should resolve this:

1. **Restart the Python service** (important!)
   ```bash
   # Stop current service (Ctrl+C)
   cd C:\Github\tcc-maem\recognition
   python service.py
   ```

2. **Watch the startup logs** - You should see:
   ```
   ‚úÖ Started X background threads
   üé¨ Starting background thread for camera 1
   ‚úÖ Background processing started for camera 1
   üìπ Camera 1: 100 frames captured
   ```

3. **Refresh browser** - Hard refresh (Ctrl+F5)

## Debugging Commands

### Check if service is running
```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:5000/health
```

Should return: `{"status":"ok"}`

### Check recognition status
```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:5000/status
```

Should return JSON with recognition logs

### Check Laravel API
```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/cameras
```

Should return array of cameras

### List recordings
```bash
dir C:\Github\tcc-maem\storage\app\public\stream_recordings
```

Should show `.mp4` files if recording works

### Play a recording
Open in VLC or browser:
```
http://127.0.0.1:8000/storage/stream_recordings/camera_1_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.mp4
```

## What's Been Fixed

### Fix 1: Added `_cap` initialization
**Problem:** RTSPVideoTrack didn't initialize `self._cap`
**Solution:** Added `self._cap = None` in `__init__`

### Fix 2: Recording uses shared frames
**Problem:** Recording opened separate RTSP connection, blocking WebRTC
**Solution:** Recording now reads from shared frame buffer

### Fix 3: Background threads start immediately
**Problem:** Background threads might start late
**Solution:** `_start_background_recognition()` called before web server starts

### Fix 4: Added comprehensive logging
**Problem:** Hard to diagnose what's failing
**Solution:** Added detailed logging at every step

## Expected Behavior

When everything works correctly:

1. **Service starts:**
   ```
   üöÄ Starting TCC-MAEM Recognition Service...
   ‚úÖ Loaded 1 cameras
   ‚úÖ Started 1 background threads
   üåê Starting web server on port 5000...
   ```

2. **Background threads run:**
   ```
   ‚úÖ Background processing started for camera 1
   üìπ Camera 1: 100 frames captured
   üìπ Camera 1: 200 frames captured
   ```

3. **Browser shows video:**
   - Video plays smoothly
   - Bounding boxes appear around faces
   - Recognition logs update every 2 seconds

4. **Recordings save:**
   - New .mp4 file every 3 minutes
   - Files are playable
   - Database records created

## Still Not Working?

If you've tried everything and it's still showing black:

1. **Check your RTSP URL format:**
   ```
   rtsp://username:password@ip:port/stream
   rtsp://192.168.1.100:554/stream1
   ```

2. **Test with test script:**
   ```bash
   python recognition/test_connection.py
   ```

3. **Check Python packages:**
   ```bash
   pip install opencv-python-headless aiortc aiohttp requests python-dotenv insightface
   ```

4. **Provide error logs:**
   - Copy all terminal output from service.py
   - Copy browser console errors (F12)
   - Share for further debugging

## Next Steps

After fixing:
1. ‚úÖ Restart Python service
2. ‚úÖ Watch for background thread logs
3. ‚úÖ Refresh browser (Ctrl+F5)
4. ‚úÖ Check if video appears
5. ‚úÖ Verify recordings still save
